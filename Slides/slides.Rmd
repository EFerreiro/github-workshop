# Programme of the workshop 

+ **Version Control Systems**, **Git** and **GitHub**

+ Application of git in **RStudio** IDE;

+ Application of git in **GitHub desktop**.

# What is Git?<br>What is GitHub? {data-background=#4B0082}

## Git

**Git** is a <span style="color:#CACCCD">distributed</span> <span style="color:#FFA07A">**version control system**</span>  

+ each client (user) has its own local copy  
<span style="color:#FFA07A"> => **local repository**</span>  
  
+ which can be synchronized with a copy stored on external server  
<span style="color:#FFA07A"> => **remote repository**</span>


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4}
library(networkD3)
source(here::here("Slides", "R", "remote_graph.R"))
remote_graph()
```

## GitHub

<P ALIGN=LEFT>**GitHub** is a commercial <span style="color:#FFA07A">Git repository hosting service</span>  
with some extra functionalities:</span>  

+ cloud-based service
+ web-based graphical interface
+ issue tracker 
+ basic project management functionalities, access granting etc.
+ Extended free plan:  
    
    + unlimited private repositories
    + unlimited collaborators 


# Why do you (might) need it? {data-background=#4B0082}


## Why do you (might) need it?

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("rmd", "temp", "for_graph.svg"))
```

## Why do you need it for yourself?

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '120%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "version_control_comics.jpg"))
```
<font size="3">Source: *https://smutch.github.io/VersionControlTutorial/*</font>

## Why do you need it for yourself?

+ <span style="color:#FFA07A">track changes:</span> always have the most **recent version** of a file, while keeping the entire **history of changes**  
+ <span style="color:#FFA07A">experiment:</span> you can **experiment** with your code  
and **revert changes** if needed  
+ <span style="color:#FFA07A">multiple instances:</span> you can have several version of your code  
and easily switch between them  
+ in case of using a remote repository (e.g. GitHub):  
  
  
  + <span style="color:#FFA07A">backup</span> in a cloud (with all the above)  
  + <span style="color:#FFA07A">easy</span> access from multiple devices  
  + use <span style="color:#FFA07A">issues</span> to make notes to the future self

## Why do you need it for sharing?

+ searchable repositories  
+ created to share a code  
+ easy to attached a web-based description of your code (`README.md`) file  
e.g. https://github.com/r-spatial/leafgl
+ easy to install directly from github  
(e.g. `remotes::install_github("r-lib/remotes")` )

## Why do you need it for collaboration?

+ **Git** is distributed: all collaborators work on their own local copy  
(code, its versions and all the **history** of changes)  
+ All collaborators can work simultaneously
+ Grant access even to private repositories  
+ Share (and test!) a developer version of your code  
+ pull request: revise changes before merging them  
+ contributions are transparent  
+ issues:  
    + search for help, ask questions and discuss, request new features / modifications  
    + easy to link to commits, cross-connect to other issues, bug tracker  
    + assignees, mentions and notifications  


# Basic vocabulary {data-background=#4B0082}

## Repo

<span style="color:#FFA07A">Repo</span>sitory is like a main *folder* of your project.  
It may contain any type of files, (sub)folders etc.  

Golden rule: <span style="color:#FFA07A">**one project one repo**</span>sitory.

+ <span style="color:#FFA07A">Local repository</span> is located on the user's computer.  
+ <span style="color:#FFA07A">Remote repository</span> is located on remote server. 

<br> 

<span style="color:#FFA07A">`README`</span> file: not required but highly recommended.  
Describes the repo, may contain documentation, use-cases or  
any other information you think may be useful for a potential user (including yourself!)


# Create new repo  {data-background=#4B0082}

<style type="text/css">
.clearer {clear: both}
.column-left1{
  float: left;
  width: 48%;
  text-align: centre;
}
.column-centre1{
  float: centre;
  width: 4%;
  text-align: centre;
}
.column-right1{
  float: right;
  width: 48%;
  text-align: centre;
}
</style>

## Create remote repository on GitHub

<br>  

Go to your GitHub account and select <span style="color:#FFA07A">**New repository**</span>  

<br>  

```{r github sign up 1, echo=FALSE, out.width = '35%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "new_repo_01.png"))
```

## Name your repository

+ Should be a character string (without space)

+ No *official* naming convention, but hyphens are mostly used to separate words
</span>

<div class="column-left1">
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "new_repo_02_name.png"))
```
</div>

<div class="column-right1">
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "new_repo_03_name.png"))
```
</div><div class="clearer"></div> 


+ <span style="color:#FFA07A; background-color:rgba(255,244,204,.1)">**`Great repository names are short and memorable.`**</span>

<br>  

Besides repository name you can:

+ add a brief <span style="color:#FFA07A">description</span>  (read: **you should**)

+ create <span style="color:#FFA07A">`README.md`</span> file (yes, you **want** do that)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "new_repo_08_readme.png"))
```

## Make decision: public or private?

<br> 

+ **public** repository is, well, public (anyone can see it, clone it etc.)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "new_repo_09_public.png"))
```

+ **private** repository is visible only for you or anyone you grant access to it. It is a good solution:      

  + testing, experiments, etc.
  + for early-stage projects (for some reason you don't want to share it yet)  
  + for all *in-progress* stuff  
  + for any project should not be publicly visible  
  
## Public to private or private to public?<br>Not a problem! (usually)  
  
<br>

+ you can change it anytime:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "new_repo_10_settings.png"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "new_repo_11_danger_zone.png"))
```

## Add **.gitignore**

<span style="color:#FFA07A">**.gitignore**</span> contains a list of all files that **should not** be included in the repo.

It's highly recommended to inlcude <span style="color:#FFA07A">**.gitignore**</span> into your repository.  

GitHub offers a list of `.gitignore` templates.  
Select the one which fits you the best.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '35%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "new_repo_04_gitignore.png"))
```


## Select a licence

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '20%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "new_repo_05_licence.png"))
```

## New repo on github: summary

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "new_repo_06.png"))
```

## The look of a brand new repository

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "new_repo_07.png"))
```

# Now it is your turn!<br><br>Create your first repository  {data-background=#008080}

+ create new, **public** repository on github
+ inlcude `README` and `.gitignore` (`R`)

# Basic vocabulary {data-background=#4B0082}

## Clone repo

<span style="color:#FFA07A">Clone</span> creates a local *copy* of a remote repository

It contains all project's files and full project's history. 



## Commit

<span style="color:#FFA07A">Commit</span> is a `snapshot` of the repository.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_commit_01.png"))
```

*Commits are cheap*.  
Commit often. 

## Commits 

<p align = left>Each commit has its own identifier.</p>  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_commit_03.png"))
```

<p align = left>You can:  
+ have an access to the repository at a given stage  
+ revise changes made by particular commit</p>  

## Revision of changes

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_commit_02.png"))
```

## Commit messages

Each commit must contain a message.  
Add **useful**, **self-explanatory** messages.  


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git_commit.png")
```

# Git workflow {data-background=#4B0082}

## File states

1. <span style="color:#9BBB59">Committed</span>: form part of the repo in the current form  
Git keep their most recent state and full history of changes  

1. <span style="color:#FD1B1A">Untracked</span>: git *sees* them but has no clue what's your point, yet

1. <span style="color:#FCD5B5">Staged</span>: their current form is *frozen* and can be added to  *commit*.  
In case of further changes, you need unstage and stage it again.  

1. <span style="color:#FFA07A">Ignored</span>: git *doesn't see* nor it's interested whether they are changed or not.  
You need to explicitly *inform* git to ignore a file


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "workflow_01.png"))
```
