## Set up GitHub Desktop


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_01.png"))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_02.png"))
```

## Create new repository

Go to File -> New repository (or `Ctrl + N`)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_03.png"))
```

## Create remote repository

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_04.png"))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '45%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_05.png"))
```

For the sake of your mental health:  
**use the same name for both, local and remote repository**!

## Add a file to your local repository 

You can just simply copy a file to your repo's folder:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '45%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_06.png"))
```

GitHub desktop offers default commit messages  
(such sophisticated as: *Create file.txt* or *Update file.txt*)

## Commit and push changes

Once you commit you'll see, that your changes are not **pushed** to your remote repo (**1**).

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '45%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_07.png"))
```

You need to **push** commits manually (**2**)

## Create new branch

In order to create a new branch go to:  
`Branch` -> `New Branch` (or `Ctrl + Shift + N`):

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '30%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_08.png"))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '40%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_09.png"))
```

Once you created new branch, confirm which branch you are currently on:  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_10.png"))
```

## Update remote branch  

I have accidentally commit to `master` branch instead of the `my-first-new-branch`.  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_11.png"))
```

GitHub Desktop allows you to **Update** your new branch **from master**.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '15%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_12.png"))
```

## Create new issue from GitHub Desktop  

Go to `Repository` -> `Create issue on GitHub` (or `Ctrl + i`)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '15%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_13.png"))
```

You can directly refer to the issue when writing a commit message:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '30%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_18.png"))
```


## Ignore file(s), dicard (recent) changes  

Select file in **`Changes`** pane so you can: 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '25%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_14.png"))
```

+ add the file to .gitignore  
+ edit file (open in... e.g. Notepad++)  
+ discard recent changes:  

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '25%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_15.png"))
```

## Merge branch from GitHub Desktop  

You need to **check out** to the branch we want to merge (e.g. `master`)

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '20%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_16.png"))
```

Once you are done, you can delete a branch:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '35%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("img", "github_desktop_17.png"))
```

# Now it is your turn!<br>Work with GitHub Desktop {data-background=#008080}

+ Create new public repository using GitHub desktop
+ Publish it
+ Create an `issue`
+ Create `my-new-branch` and check out to it
+ Modify a file and commit changes refering to an issue
+ Merge `my-new-branch` to master and delete it.
